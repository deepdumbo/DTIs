To improve the similarity measure:

- Run the script `Demo_JaccardSim.m` . This will compute Jaccard similarity using drug-disease, drug-SE, protein-disease associaton network.
- Run the script `Demo_SRW.m` . This will run the SRW process.

(You can skip the above two steps, since we have provided the calculated results in the "Sim" folder, which were used to produce the results in our report.)



To confirm the usefulness of the algorithm by cross-validation:

- Run the script `Demo_CV.m` .

To predict drug-target interactions using the whole dataset:

- Run the script `Demo_UseAll.m` .

To find the optimal parameters values using PSO algorithm:
- Run the script `Demo_PSO.m` .
